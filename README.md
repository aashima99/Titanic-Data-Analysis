# Titanic-Data-Analysis in R

The goal of the project was to predict the survival of passengers based off a set of data.I have used the
Titanic dataset to retrieve necessary data and evaluate accuracy of the predictions.There has been done lot
of visualization in order to study the dataset. The historical data has been split into two groups, a ‘training
set’ and a ‘test set’. For the training set, we are provided with the outcome (whether or not a passenger
survived). We used this set to build our model to generate predictions for the test set. For each passenger in
the test set, we had to predict whether or not they survived the sinking. Our score was the percentage of
correctly predictions.
